For 1.9.1
=========

* Document User / Groups / Auth usage an Auth & Auth middleware
-> One user belong to one group who can have more than one permission
-> We keep the TG2 Model but use mainly permissions

* Try to replace all 'id' by other name likes page_id of person_id

For 1.9.2
=========

* Try to use FormAlchemy in forms ?

* Move all 'photos' etc inside 'persons' ?

* For lists try to
- use jgrid + json (instead of paginate)
- add an option for item/pages

* avoid usage of c.userid inside the audit models. Try to find a way to
send it as argument


* Check label form css align
to test -> change .login class to max-width: <500px

* Use index pages and/or replace by lists
- last changes ?


* Try to use refer to track what user are doing and
- say no if they bind directly some pages instead of using links
(like new / edit /delete) 
- maybe use secure_form to avoid refer hacks
- redirect them to the page they comme from when they have finisih something
For exemple :
user is at "show user" and click link to add an user address
when address si corectly added the user is send back to show user
(or assume to send it back here always ?)
