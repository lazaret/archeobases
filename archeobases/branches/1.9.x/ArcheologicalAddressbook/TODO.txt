* Document User / Groups / Auth usage an Auth & Auth middleware
-> One user belong to one group who can have more than one permission
-> We keep the TG2 Model but use mainly permissions

* Check hash password method, maybe use bcrypt

* Try to use FormAlchemy ?

* Try to replace all 'id' by other name likes page_id of person_id
- in models because it can be more clear in template and controlers
- in controllers because 'id' is a python reserved word

* Move all 'photos' etc inside 'persons' ?

* Redesign login box and login/logout mecanism add the possibility
for the user to change pass or infos

* For lists try to
- use jgrid + json (instead of paginate)
- add an option for item/pages

* Try to use refer to track what user are doing and
- say no if they bind directly some pages instead of using links
(like new / edit /delete) maybe use secure_form to check this
- redirect them to the page they comme from when they have finisih something
For exemple :
user is at "show user" and click link to add an user address
when addres si corectly add the user is send back to show user
(or assume to send it back here always ?)


* Finish search feature
* Finish stats feature (maybe move it outside his controller)

* Add database changes tracking
* add database schema-migration

* Add photo/image upload feature and auto-recrop

* Use index pages and/or replace by lists
- stats ?
- last changes ?
- search form ?

* Add relations testings for Auth Model
