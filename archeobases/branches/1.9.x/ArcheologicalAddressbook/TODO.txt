* Document User / Groups / Auth usage an Auth & Auth middleware
-> One user belong to one group who can have more than one permission
-> We keep the TG2 Model but use mainly permissions

* Check hasj password method, maybe use bcrypt

* Try to use FormAlchemy ?

* Try to replace all 'id' by other name likes page_id of person_id
(beacause 'id' is a reserved word)

* Be more clear in Persons ans Users docstrings

* Move all 'users' controller tamplates inside 'admin' ?

* Add case changes for some fields in forms :
username -> always lowercase
email -> always lowercase
last name -> always upercase
first name -> camel case
