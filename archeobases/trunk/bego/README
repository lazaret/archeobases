This is "archeobases-bego" a part of the Archeobases project from the Lazaret archaeological laboratory.

Bego is a set of Python script and a PostgreSQL database used to maintain our Mont Bégo database.
This script is very related to the Mont Bégo studies and a lot of fields database drop-down menus are predefined under the scripts.
We have futures project to change the database and the script for a more "universal one" who can be used on other external rock engraving sites like the Mont Bego, Fos Coa, Valcamonica. But this is a very long-term project as this need first to work on the different study methods used.
