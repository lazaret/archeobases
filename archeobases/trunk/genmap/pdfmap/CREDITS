Bernhard Herzog and Bernhard Reiter from Intevation GmbH,
http://www.intevation.de/ for the Europe map and dataset,
and for MapIt, http://www.mapit.de/ which gave me the idea
to generalise this software to other maps than
archaeological ones.

The ReportLab team, http://www.reportlab.com/ for their
wonderful software, and their patience with me ;-)

Geraldine Chouard http://wwwusers.imaginet.fr/~chouard/
for the nice Eiffel Tower picture.
