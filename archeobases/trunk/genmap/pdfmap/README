============================================================

PDFMap is both a Python module and a command line tool which
allows people to easily create very high quality maps in
PDF format.

It serves successfully in drawing archaelogical objects
on cave maps, but as the examples may show you, it can
also draw things at a very high scale, e.g. an Europe
or World map.

Each document can contain multiple maps (one per page).

Each map can have an optional rasterized background which
can be rotated automatically if it is not North oriented.

PDFMap can automatically draw objects on each map. Objects
can be of any type (e.g. City, School, Archaeological
objects, whatever you like), and are represented by
shapes or images, scaled to the actual object's dimensions
and orientation. Each object can also have an associated
url which will render the object clickable in tools
like Adobe Acrobat Reader (NB : the clickable area is
always a rectangle of the actual object's dimensions, not
of the representing shape's dimensions), the use of this
feature depends entirely on your imagination : draw
maps from a database and link back to a web enabled
application which manipulates this database is just
an example (and an interesting one at that, just
believe me).

PDFMap uses two types of input files :

        - Configuration files :

          Those are used to tell PDFMap which shape or image
          should represent each type of object, as well as
          set different parameters for this object's type :
          pen thickness, colors, minimal and maximal size,
          etc...

        - Data files :

          Those are used to feed PDFMap with lists of objects
          to draw. They are generally the result of an ASCII
          export from your favorite spreadsheet or relational
          database management system.

The tests/ subdirectory contains sample configuration and data
files which are well commented. Read them and run the tests
programs to learn how PDFMap works.

============================================================

Command line options :
======================

        pdfmap [options] [[inputfile1] [inputfile2] ...]

options :

  -v | --version          prints PDFMap's version number then exits
  -h | --help             prints this message then exits

  --config file.cfg       uses file.cfg as the configuration file
  --outputfile file.pdf   uses file.pdf as the output file, otherwise sends
                          the output to stdout
  --author authorname     uses authorname as the document author's name
  --title doctitle        uses doctitle as the document's title
  --subtitle docsubtitle  uses docsubtitle as the document's subtitle

  --papersize psize       uses psize as the paper size. psize can be any
                          paper size natively recognized by the ReportLab
                          ToolKit, expressed in UPPERCASE (i.e. A4 or LETTER
                          for example), or any size expressed as 'WxH' where
                          W and H respectively are Width and Height of
                          the page in centimeters (e.g. 21x29.7 for A4).
                          For each dimension, you can specify a unit which
                          may be different from one dimension to the other.
                          Allowed units are :
                            cm : centimeters (DEFAULT)
                            in : inches
                            pt : points
                            (e.g. 8.5inx11in for LETTER)

  --orientation o         uses o as the paper orientation, which must be
                          either "portrait" or "landscape"

  --leftmargin lm         left margin
  --bottommargin bm       bottom margin
  --rightmargin rm        right margin
  --topmargin tm          top margin
                          You can choose the unit in which you express
                          the four margins, sticking either 'cm', 'in',
                          or 'pt' at the end of each number.
                            cm : centimeters (DEFAULT)
                            in : inches
                            pt : points
                            (e.g. 100pt for 100 points)

  --legend                generates the map legend, default is no legend

  --bgmap image.jpeg      uses image.jpeg as the map background. Most graphic
                          formats are allowed, and you can also give an URL
                          to download the background from a remote location.
  --bgx x                 X position of the map background in units
  --bgy y                 Y position of the map background in units
  --bgwidth w             width of the map background in units
  --bgheight h            height of the map background in units
  --bgrotation r          rotation of the map background in degres (counter
                          clockwise) wrt the North

  --xlabels labels        Labels for the X ticks
  --ylabels labels        Labels for the Y ticks
  --xalign                Align X labels on X ticks or center them (default)
  --yalign                Align Y labels on Y ticks or center them (default)

  --xorigin x             X origin of the generated map in units (from lower
                          left)
  --yorigin y             Y origin of the generated map in units (from lower
                          left)
  --xscale xs             scale for the X dimension
  --yscale ys             scale for the Y dimension
  --xstep stx             distance between two X ticks in units
  --ystep sty             distance between two Y ticks in units

  --rotation r            angle of the generated map in degres (counter

============================================================

Prerequisite :
==============

You need to have installed the following software
before being able to launch the test programs :

        Python - The Python language
        Download it from http://www.python.org

        PIL - The Python Imaging Library :
        Download it from http://www.pythonware.com

        ReportLab - The ReportLab ToolKit :
        Download it from http://www.reportlab.com
        (You'll need version 1.14 or above, but 
        beware : recent versions can't open images
        via http anymore, this functionnality will
        be readded to ReportLab in the future though)

        JAXML - The jaxml Python module :
        Download it from http://cortex.unice.fr/~jerome/
        This module is currently not needed unless you
        try to run PDFMap as a CGI script.

  For those of you who run Debian, the following will
do all the necessary steps for you (launch this as root) :

  # apt-get install python jaxml python-reportlab python-imaging

  If you run a recent GNU/Linux distribution of any sort,
the Python language is probably already installed.

Note for Windows users :
------------------------

  The easiest for you to make PDFMap work, is probably to
download ReportLab Demo from http://www.reportlab.com
ReportLab Demo is a big (7 Mb) bundle which installs Python,
ReportLab, PIL, and configure Windows correctly to execute Python
scripts.

After having installed ReportLab Demo, you should be able to
launch all PDFMap's tests successfully (tested under Win98, with
ReportLab Demo 1.11). The tests/europe.bat script expects you
have installed ReportLab Demo in C:\REPORTLAB (default) and
PDFMap somewhere on the same disk.

============================================================

Installation :
==============

        NB : Windows installation will not be described here, although
it should be very similar to the GNU/Linux installation instructions
described below :

        Now that you've installed the necessary Python modules,
and tried the test programs in the tests/ subdirectory, you really
enjoy PDFMap and you want to install it your system :

        Although PDFMap works fine with Python 1.5.2, installing
it requires that you've got the Distutils package installed.
Unfortunately the Distutils module is not part of Python 1.5.2,
so you have to download it separately from :

        http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/

        If you use a Python version above 2.0 then Distutils
is probably already installed, if not then read above and
install it.

Once Distutils is installed :

        * extract the PDFMap tar+gzip archive (if you're reading
          this file then you've probably already done this) :

                $ gunzip <pdfmap-x.xx.tar.gz | tar -xf -

        * install PDFMap :

                $ cd pdfmap-x.xx
                $ python ./setup.py install

        That's all.

        NB : in the lines above, x.xx represents PDFMap's version
        number.

You can now use PDFMap from the command line or import it
in your own Python programs. To use it from the command line :

        $ pdfmap --help

If you plan to import this module in your own
Python software, you'll have to do something like :

      >>> from pdfmap import maptool
