The sample scripts europe.sh, europe.py and europe.bat, will
produce a map of Europe and draw on this map some symbols to
represent cities and capitols. The europe.sh script is Unix
specific, while the europe.bat script is Windows specific. The
europe.py script works both under Unix and under Windows.

The sample dataset comes from the MapIt project, which is
downloadable from :

	http://www.mapit.de/

and I was generously allowed to include it in this project
by Bernhard Reiter and Bernhard Herzog, from Intevation GmbH.

I was generously allowed to include the Eiffel Tower picture
by Geraldine Chouard (http://wwwusers.imaginet.fr/~chouard).

To produce the map of Europe with pdfmap, simply type :

	$ ./europe.sh europe.datas

or :

	$ ./europe.py europe.datas

Windows users have to launch either :

	C:\PDFMAP\TESTS> europe.bat europe.datas

or :

	C:\PDFMAP\TESTS> python europe.py europe.datas

Then view or print it with any tool of your choice,
some examples are : Adobe Acrobat Reader, gv, xpdf

	$ acroread europe.pdf

Some tools like Adobe Acrobat Reader will then
allow you to click on each city or capitol to
view Google's search results about this town.

Both europe.py, europe.bat and europe.sh produce exactly
the same map, although the size of the resulting pdf
files may differ a bit. Reading these scripts as well
as the configuration file europe.conf and the data file
europe.datas will help you in understanding how
to use successfully pdfmap with your own datas.

When viewing europe.pdf, don't be afraid of seing
the big logo of my freelancer company at the upper
left. This won't appear on your own maps provided
you don't put a file named "calllogo.png" in
your application's directory.

If you plan to produce some maps from your own
datas and don't know how to do, then you can
buy some consulting time. Just send me an email
describing where your datas come from (MSExcel, RDBMS...)
and what they look like, and I'll send you a quote with
great pleasure ;-)

Buying some consulting time will help improve this
software, but you can also help improve it by sending
patches, sample datasets and maps (which must be Freely
redistributable, and for no fee), etc...

Enjoy !
