# Sample configuration file for pdfmap
#
# Each line is composed from nine fields separated with ':'
# Some fields are optional.
# Empty lines or lines beginning with a '#' are ignored.
#
# Each line has the following form :
#
#
# Nature : Shape : Thickness : RGBout : RGBin : Magnify : MinimalSize : MaximalSize : Description
#
#
# Nature :
#          Can be any string, which represents an object nature
#          in the data input file. A mandatory 'DEFAULT' entry
#          must be present to represent objects with an unknown
#          nature. This field is case sensitive.
#          Examples of natures : House, Rock, Tree, City, etc...
#
# Shape :
#          The shape in which all objects of nature 'Nature' will
#          be represented on the map.
#          Valid shapes are : Circle, Square, Rectangle, Ellipse,
#                             Triangle, Star, Cross, Diamond, Image,
#                             more to come...
#
# Thickness :
#          Defines the width of the pen when drawing shapes. Unused
#          when the Shape is an Image. You can consider it similar
#          to the Shape's contour width.
#          Default value is 0.01, which is very thin.
#
# RGBout, RGBin :
#          Each one is a triplet of real values between 0 and 1
#          of the form : r, g, b which represent respectively
#          the part of Red, Green, Blue which made the color.
#          0, 0, 0 is Black, while 1, 1, 1 is White.
#          RGBout is the color of the outside of the shape.
#          RGBin is the color of the inside of the shape. If
#          RGBin is omitted the the shape will not be filled
#          and will only be visible from its contour in RGBout
#          color.
#          For Image shapes, the RGBout field contains the name
#          of an image file in almost any graphic format which
#          will be used to draw objects of this nature. The image
#          filename can also be an URL to a remote image in any
#          protocol supported by the Python Standard Library.
#          NB: in this case you must enclose this field between
#          double quotes. The RGBout can also contain a directory 
#          name in which case image files contained in this 
#          directory will be used at random to represent these 
#          objects.
#          For Image shapes, the RGBin may be used to specify
#          a color to mask (render transparent) in the image,
#          in the same format as for other type of Shapes.
#          It can also contain "auto" which tells PDFMap to
#          try to detected the transparent color automatically.
#          If this field is empty, then auto is assumed.
#
# Magnify :
#          An optional magnifying factor applied to
#          each object's dimensions (both length and width).
#          Using a value between 0 and 1 is allowed to specify
#          a reducing factor to both dimensions. If omitted
#          then a default value of 1 is used, meaning no
#          magnification will be done : objects will be
#          represented at their real dimensions on the map,
#          in the current scale.
#
# MinimalSize :
#          An optional minimal size of the shape in square units
#          (e.g. square meters) under which no object is drawn.
#          The default value is 0, meaning that all objects are drawn.
#          WARNING : The test is done *after* the application of the
#          magnifying factor.
#
# MaximalSize :
#          An optional maximal size of the shape in square units
#          (e.g. square meters) above which no object is drawn.
#          The default value is sys.maxint, meaning that most regular
#          objects are drawn.
#          WARNING : The test is done *after* the application of the
#          magnifying factor.
#
# Description :
#          Optional free text to be displayed in the legend for
#          the current nature. If omitted then the nature is used
#          in the legend. Example : School or University
#
# Each city will be represented by a little yellow star,
# downloaded from my homepage
