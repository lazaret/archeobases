*************************

The script and the module use the Python distutils packaging system.
Just be sure first than Python is installed on your computer.

| tar zxvf savetape-x.x.tar.gz

3) Enter into this directory and just type :
| python setup.py install

4) Create symbolic links to automate the scripts.
For example for a weekkly save on tape:
| ln -s /usr/local/bin/savetotape.sh /etc/cron.weekly/savetotape.sh

5) Change the configuration file if necessary :
/etc/savetape.conf

Note : The setup.py script will :
- Install a module for the script under /sur/local/lib/python2.x/site-packages/savetape.py
(or under /usr/local/lib64 if you have a x64 machine)
- Install script under /usr/local/bin :
