Installation Instructions
*************************


The script and the module use the Python-setuptools packaging systems.
Just be sure than Python is installed on your computer.
If you do not have already the setuptools package installed, the setup.py script will automaticaly
use the ez_setup.py bootstrap to install savetape. You may install first setuptools with :
| python ez_setup.py




To install as root :

1) Unpack the distribution somewhere like /usr/local/src
| tar zxvf savetape-x.x.tar.gz

3) Enter into this directory and just type :
| python setup.py install

4) Create symbolic links to automate the scripts.
For example for a daily save :
| ln -s /usr/local/bin/savetotape.sh /etc/cron.daily/savetotape.sh


Note : The setup.py script will :
- Create a module for the scripts under /sur/local/lib/python2.x/site-packages/savetape.py
(or under /usr/local/lib64 if you have a x64 machine)
- Create script under /usr/local/bin :
/usr/local/bin/savetotape.sh
